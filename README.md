# pic32_usb_host_bootloader
USB HOST bootloader for Microchip PIC32

This is a USB Host bootloader with FT800 Display and simple Buzzer support.

The project was tested using 32MX250F128D but it could be adapted to a few other PIC32 microcontrollers. In order to do that choose appropriate linker script in 'linker_scripts' folder.
